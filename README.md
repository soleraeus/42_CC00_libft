# 42 School Paris - libft

Very first project from 42 School Paris' Common Core.

The goal is simple: create your own library which implements your own version of some standard functions from the libc library and some other useful custom functions (such as split or linked lists-related functions).

To create the library **libft.a** clone the repository and run `make` to include only mandatory functions of `make bonus` to include bonus functions (mainly linked lists-related functions), then include **libft.h** in your project to use the functions and compile your project with the library. If you need more details on some function, read subject.pdf included in this repository.

The Makefile supports the commands:

- `make`
- `make libft.a`
- `make all`
- `make bonus`
- `make clean`
- `make fclean`
- `make re` (only recompiles mandatory functions)
